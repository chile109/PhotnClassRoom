This is the VR experience class room for voice presentation. The scenario is like ClubHouse where the teacher can hold a classroom where students can join it to hear lessons, and they are all in a VR place that supports HMD interaction. Also teachers can pick some students to be the speaker, both support mute features.

- [x] XR Interaction toolkit integration
- [x] Photon PUN2 and Voice2 integration
- [x] Teacher avatar with rollCall and mute feature
- [x] Student avatar with raise hand for speak
- [x] Lobby room list with login page
- [x] Optimization for limit number rendering and voice
- [x] Decorate Environment
- [x] Export WIN/AOS and test on Quest2
